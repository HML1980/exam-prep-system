1. C should have + V-p.p. (1) KE

had known; might have made • 
D 本題考表示「(過去)要不是...,就會...」的假設語氣用法,句型 
如下: 
Without/ But for / If it hadn't been for / But that + S + V-ed 十名詞, 
S+ would / could/should/might + have V-p.p. 
= S + would / could/should/might + have V-p.p. without / 
but for /if it hadn't been for / but that +S+ V-ed + . 根據上述用法,應選 but for

解析內容 
基礎養成篇 假設語氣 
4. D 英文中要表達「過去應做而未做的動作」的固定用法為 should + have V-p.p. ought to + have V-p.p.,本題按語意是要表達「過 去不該做而做了的動作」,得知應用 shouldn't + have V-p.p.或 ought not to + have V-p.p.,因此應選 shouldn't have。 
5. C 本題考表示「萬一」的假設語氣用法,其句型如下: 
6. B 
7. 
If S + should +原形動詞,S+助動詞+原形動詞/祈使句 
= Should S+原形動詞+動詞+原形動詞/祈使句 
根據上述用法,本題應選 should snow。 
本題考「未來有可能發生」的假設語氣用法,句型如下: If + S + 現在簡單式,S+現在式助動詞+原形動詞根據上述句型,應選 will 
become. 
本題考「和過去事實相反的假設語氣用法,句型如下: 
If S + had V-p.p., S + would/could/should/might + have V-p.p. 
= Had S + V-p.p., S+ would/could/should/might+have V-p.p. 根據上述句型,本題應選 could have got。 
8. A本句為表「未來幾乎不可能發生」的假設語氣用法,原句應為: 
According to... (WHO), if any of the classified dangerous diseases 
were to break out, the measure...,為簡化句子,可將if 省略,並將 be動詞 were 移至原子句主詞前方,故本題應選 were 
9. C 本題考「和現在事實相反」的假設語氣用法,其句型如下: 
If S + were / V-ed, S + would / could / should/ might + 原形 動詞 
= S + + would/ could/should/might +原形動詞ifS + were 
/ V-ed 
根據上述句型,本題應選過去式動詞 knew。 
10. D 本題考「和現在事實相反」的假設語氣用法,得知 be 動詞應用 
were,因此應選 weren't raining。

3. 
A 
4. 
A 
5. D 
本句原應為 Are you familiar with the places which are mentioned in the TV show?,為簡化句子可省略關係代名詞 which 及be動詞 are,因此應選 mentioned。 
空格所在的子句為補充說明前方先行詞 Alice Freeman 的同位語,得 知應採關係子句,且根據語意,該子句時態應為過去式,因此應選 
who was appointed • 
。 
空格前後為兩個完整子句,空格應填連接詞。 as soon as 為表示時間 的從屬連接詞,其後所接的子句表示「一...就...」 
選項(B)because of 雖然也表示「因為」,但(B)後面需加名詞或動 名詞,而本題空格的後面為一子句,用法不合故不可選。 
選項(A)(B)(D)都表示「相反」的意思,但(A)(B)為獨立片語(即 後面不接受詞),而本題空格後有作受詞的名詞子句what other 
students think(其他學生的想法),用法不合故皆不可選,因此應 選 Contrary to。

D 
9. B 
10. B 
解析內容 
空格前沒有先行詞,而空格後有關係子句comes up with the best name for the new fragrance(為這款新香水想出最棒名字),得知 空格應置複合關係代名詞以引導關係子句。按語意,空格指的是 人,且空格後為動詞,因此應選代替人且為主格的複合關係代名詞 
whoever 
(A)彷彿 (B)好像 (C)雖然 (D) 因此 
be 動詞 is 後面需接名詞或形容詞作為補語,而本題空格後方為一完 整子句,因此應選引導名詞子句的連接詞 that。 
本題考間接問句的用法,得知空格應採「疑問詞+主詞+動詞」的 順序,且句子時態為現在簡單式,因此應選 where she lives。 
本句原應為 The clever device which is installed on the wall makes the 
room...,省略關係代名詞 which 及be動詞 is 後即成本句,因此應選 
installed。
