答案&解析 
題號答案

解析內容 
1. C 本題考 have no choice but to V(不得不...)的固定用法, 因此 
cancel 應改為 to cancel。 
2. C 
動詞 help 加受詞後,可加不定詞表目的(其中to 可省略),因此 finding 應改為 to find 或 find。 
3. C 
本題使用不定詞作形容詞修飾名詞 approach,因此 to elimination 應 改為 to eliminate。 
4. D 本題使用不定詞做為 the students 的補語,因此 staying 應改為 
to stay 
5. B 
不定詞的否定式應用 not to V,因此 to not 應改為 not to。 
6. 
C 
按語意,本題應採不定詞的被動語態,且後方沒有受詞,故不用加 to,因此應選 to be listened。 
7. C C 本題考 enable 人 to V (讓某人可以...)的固定用法,因此應選 
to go。 
8. 
B 
本題考 be determined to V(決定要...)的固定用法,因此應選 to try。 
9. D 
本題考 teach toV(教某人做...)的固定用法,因此應選 us to be。 
10. 
C 
本題考「某人或某物看起來似乎...」的用法,常用句型如下: 
S + seem + adj. = S + seem + to V = S + seem like + N 根據上述用法,本題應選 to be nice。
